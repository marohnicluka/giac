# graph-theory
Graph theory package for Giac computer algebra system

This repository contains a collection of graph theory commands for Giac which are compatible with the corresponding Maple commands.

Implemented algorithms are reasonably fast, operating with STL containers of integers.
All the hard work is done within the *graphe* class.

## Features
- reading and writing .dot files
- graph visualization using spring-electrical model (with an adaptation for planar graphs)
- various commands for graph manipulation
