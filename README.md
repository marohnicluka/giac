My contributions to [Giac/Xcas](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html) computer algebra system, including the support for:

- graph theory (a comprehensive package containing over 200 commands, see [doc/graphtheory-user_manual.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marohnicluka/giac/master/doc/graphtheory-user_manual.pdf) for details)
- signal processing and audio (creating wave files, convolution and (auto)correlation, filtering, windowing, resampling, noise removal)
- images
- continuous Fourier transforms
- constrained optimization in multivariate calculus (local and global extrema)
- calculus of variations
- numerical differentiation (Fornberg's algorithm)
- (mixed integer) (non)linear programming
- transportation problems
- curve interpolation and fitting (Thiele's algorithm, Floater and Hormann's algorithm, trigonometric polynomial fitting, Remez algorithm)
- simplification of trigonometric expressions
- statistics (discrete random variables with sampling, kernel density estimation, maximum-likelihood fitting)
- ordinary differential equations (an implementation of Kovacic's algorithm and a second-degree boundary value problems solver)
- Diophantine equations
- K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering
- feed-forward neural networks
- LaTeX/MathML/TeXmacs conversion of Giac output
- using Giac in TeXmacs
