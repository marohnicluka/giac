My contributions to [Giac/Xcas](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html) computer algebra system, including:

- graph theory (a comprehensive set of algorithms with over 150 commands, see doc/graphtheory-user_manual.pdf for details)
- signal processing and audio tools (creating wave files, convolution and (auto)correlation, filtering, windowing, resampling, noise removal)
- optimization in multivariate calculus (finding local and global extrema)
- calculus of variations
- (mixed integer) linear programming, transportation problem solver
- curve interpolation (Thiele's algorithm, trigonometric polynomial fitting, Remez algorithm)
- simplification of trigonometric expressions
- statistics (continuous and discrete random variables with sampling, kernel density estimation, maximum-likelihood fitting)
- ordinary differential equations (an implementation of Kovacic's algorithm, a second-degree boundary value problems solver)
