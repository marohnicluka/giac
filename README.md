# A graph theory package for Giac

This package contains a collection of graph theory commands for the Giac CAS which are compatible with the corresponding Maple commands. It is a work in progress.

The commands are listed in the file "graphtheory.h". The implementation of the commands serves as a Giac interface to the **graphe** class which does all the hard work.

This library is written in C++ from scratch and has no mandatory dependencies save the Giac itself. Although the focus is on simplicity, the implemented algorithms are reasonably fast.

See the "shorthelp.txt" and "graphtheory-user_manual.pdf" files for the details of command usage.
